//! Goal: give Kubernetes something to probe for a process that never
//! listens for anything else.
//!
//! This service's work loop only makes outbound calls, so a failure has no
//! inbound surface to show up on: a process that cannot enroll, or whose
//! instance lease has expired, keeps running and keeps logging, and
//! Kubernetes sees a healthy container. That is the worst shape a failure
//! can take -- indistinguishable from success on every dashboard.
//!
//! Readiness and liveness are both driven by one fact: when this process
//! last completed a scheduling pass against the kernel. A pass that fails
//! does not update it, so a service stuck on 401 or 403 goes stale and is
//! reported unhealthy.
//!
//! Liveness matters more than readiness here, and deliberately so. Nothing
//! routes traffic to this service, so being "not ready" changes nothing on
//! its own. But an expired instance lease cannot be renewed -- the kernel
//! rejects the renewal along with every other signed call -- and the only
//! recovery is to restart and enroll again. A liveness probe is what makes
//! that restart happen without a human.
