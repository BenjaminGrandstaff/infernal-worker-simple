//! Goal: mirror the kernel's instance lease renewal wire format
//! (`src/http/instance_renewal_dto.rs` in infernal-law). An enrolled
//! instance's lease is short (60 seconds by kernel default) and the
//! kernel exposes no other way to extend it, so a process that intends to
//! keep polling past that must renew proactively, well before expiry --
//! see `lib.rs`'s `run` for how this is scheduled.
